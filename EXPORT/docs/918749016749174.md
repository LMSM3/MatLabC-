# Friday Mission
**Goal:** Run the session cleanly, validate outputs, and leave behind a sane paper trail.

## 1) Top Priorities (Do These First)
- [ ] **Launch (recommended):** run `START.ps1` (interactive launcher)
- [ ] **Read the master guide:** `RUNME_20250124.md` (understand the flow)
- [ ] **Do the fast visual skim:** `RUNME_START_HERE.txt` (confirm you’re not missing something obvious)
- [ ] **Decision/troubleshooting ready:** keep `EXECUTE_NOW.txt` open in case reality happens
- [ ] **End-state proof:** produce and verify `FINAL_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.txt`

# 3) Friday Checklist (Minimal Pain Edition)

## A) Prep (Stop Future-You From Hating Present-You)
- [ ] Confirm you’re in the correct folder (the one containing the files above)
- [ ] Close random terminals you’re not using (optional, but psychologically helpful)
- [ ] Decide: **interactive path** (`START.ps1`) vs manual path (docs first)

## B) Run
- [ ] Start with `START.ps1`
- [ ] Follow `RUNME_20250124.md` exactly (yes, exactly)
- [ ] If something breaks, use `EXECUTE_NOW.txt` to pick the right fix path

## C) Validate (The Part Everyone “Forgets”)
- [ ] Ensure expected outputs were generated (names/locations match the docs)
- [ ] Spot-check key outputs for emptiness / truncation / obvious nonsense
- [ ] Confirm no silent failures (warnings, partial runs, missing steps)

## D) Wrap-Up (Friday Means You Leave Receipts)
- [ ] Update statuses in the table above
- [ ] Fill in the summary below
- [ ] Confirm `FINAL_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.txt` matches what actually happened
