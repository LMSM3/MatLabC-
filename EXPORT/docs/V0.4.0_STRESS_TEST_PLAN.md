Result: [TO TEST]

>>> B = [1 2; 3 4]
Expected: Output with -- marker
Result: [TO TEST]
```

### Test 19: NaN Detection (Red coloring)
```
>>> log(-1)
Expected: Red "[NaN detected]" text
Result: [TO TEST]
```

### Test 20: Inf Detection (Yellow coloring)
```
>>> 1/0
Expected: Yellow "[Inf detected]" text
Result: [TO TEST]
```

## Manual Test Instructions

### Run All Tests:
```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/Liam/Desktop/MatLabC++

# Test 1-7: Basic functions
echo "sin(0)" | ./build/mlab++
echo "cos(0)" | ./build/mlab++
echo "sqrt(4)" | ./build/mlab++
echo "exp(0)" | ./build/mlab++
echo "log(1)" | ./build/mlab++
echo "abs(-5)" | ./build/mlab++

# Test 8-11: Edge cases
echo "log(0)" | ./build/mlab++
echo "log(-1)" | ./build/mlab++
echo "sqrt(-1)" | ./build/mlab++
echo "1/0" | ./build/mlab++

# Test 12-13: Nested
echo "sin(cos(0))" | ./build/mlab++
echo "sqrt(abs(-16))" | ./build/mlab++

# Test 14-15: NEW - Matrix (will fail until integrated)
echo "A = [1 2; 3 4]" | ./build/mlab++

# Interactive testing
./build/mlab++
```

## Status: READY FOR MANUAL TESTING

**Next Steps:**
1. Run each test command
2. Check output matches expected
3. Verify no crashes on edge cases
4. Test new matrix features (once integrated)
5. Verify debug markers appear
6. Document results
